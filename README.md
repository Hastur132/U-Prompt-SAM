# U-Prompt-SAM: Unified Prompt-Driven Interactive Segmentation with Expert Feedback

Official implementation of our paper:  
**U-Prompt-SAM: Unified Prompt-Driven Interactive Segmentation with Expert Feedback**

---

## ðŸ”¥ Overview
U-Prompt-SAM is a **multi-round interactive segmentation framework** that combines:
- Automated priors
- Dense prompt initialization  
- Expert refinement with Segment Anything (SAM)  

This approach reduces the number of clicks (NoC) while improving segmentation accuracy, making it practical for medical image analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Code Release
We are currently **organizing and cleaning the code**.  
ðŸš§ The full training and evaluation pipelines, along with pretrained weights, will be released here soon. Please stay tuned!
